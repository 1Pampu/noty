# Noty!

"Noty!" is an application inspired by Twitter, designed for users to create and share notes, whether they are private or public. The platform allows dynamic interaction, where users can express appreciation for others' notes through the "likes" feature. Developed independently, the application utilizes technologies such as Django, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, supported by a MySQL database for efficient information management.

With a user-friendly and easy-to-navigate design, Noty! provides users with a seamless experience for sharing thoughts, ideas, or brief messages, encouraging social interaction through the ability to receive positive feedback via "likes."
